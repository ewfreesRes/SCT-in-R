# The Basics of SCT's

The basics of writing a submission correctness test consist of an initializing function, a "chain" function, and then varying calls of "check" functions. The initializing function has the form:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ex()
```

while the “chain” function has the form:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
%>%
```

Combining the initial function and a single call of the chain function is the beginning of all the SCTs that you can write using R, and looks like the following:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
ex() %>%
```

With this in mind, let us learn about the first set of submission correctness tests we can write.
